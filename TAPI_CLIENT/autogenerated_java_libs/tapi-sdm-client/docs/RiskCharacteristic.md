**riskIdentifierList** | **List&lt;String&gt;** |  |  [optional]
**riskCharacteristicName** | **String** | The name of the risk characteristic. The characteristic may be related to a specific degree of closeness.  For example a particular characteristic may apply to failures that are localized (e.g. to one side of a road) where as another characteristic may relate to failures that have a broader impact (e.g. both sides of a road that crosses a bridge). Depending upon the importance of the traffic being routed different risk characteristics will be evaluated. |  [optional]
