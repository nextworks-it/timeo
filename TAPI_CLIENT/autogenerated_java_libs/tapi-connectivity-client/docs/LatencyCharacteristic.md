# LatencyCharacteristic

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**queingLatencyCharacteristic** | **String** | The specific queuing latency for the traffic property. |  [optional]
**trafficPropertyName** | **String** | The identifier of the specific traffic property to which the queuing latency applies. |  [optional]
**jitterCharacteristic** | **String** | High frequency deviation from true periodicity of a signal and therefore a small high rate of change of transfer latency. Applies to TDM systems (and not packet). |  [optional]
**wanderCharacteristic** | **String** | Low frequency deviation from true periodicity of a signal and therefore a small low rate of change of transfer latency. Applies to TDM systems (and not packet). |  [optional]
**fixedLatencyCharacteristic** | **String** | A TopologicalEntity suffers delay caused by the realization of the servers (e.g. distance related; FEC encoding etc.) along with some client specific processing. This is the total average latency effect of the TopologicalEntity |  [optional]
